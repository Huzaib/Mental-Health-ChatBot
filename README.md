# Mental-Health-ChatBot

This is Eva, a mental-health chatbot.

Eva is able to converse and interact with human users using spoken, written, and visual languages.
Eva has the potential to be useful tools for individuals with mental disorders,
especially those who are reluctant to seek mental health advice due to stigmatization.
Eva is your totally anonymous companion.
Say hi and see the magic
Also, she doesn't leak secrets

## Working:

The general functional framework of mental health chatbots is based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy methodology. CBT is a form of talking therapy designed to manage mental health states by rearranging the way the patient perceives it, i.e., making negative thoughts positive.
The NLP algorithm performs sentiment analysis to detect trigger words, performs intent classification, select the most probable response and handle the flow of conversation 
Eva makes the impression of a credible and trustworthy conversation partner that can hear you out and offer a detached point of view on things.
The common flow of conversation is as follows:
* Kickstarting a topic for conversation, 
* Asking directional questions, 
* Providing follow-ups to expand responses. 

### Tested using :
* rasa run --debug command
